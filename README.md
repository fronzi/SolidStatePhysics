##  Topics Covered
The material follows the structure of the *Neamen ‚Äì Semiconductor Physics and Devices* textbook (Chapters 1‚Äì6), including:
- Crystal structure and bonding  
- Quantum mechanics applied to solids  
- Band theory of semiconductors  
- Intrinsic and extrinsic semiconductors  
- Carrier transport: drift, diffusion, mobility, conductivity  
- Non-equilibrium conditions and carrier injection

##  Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you should be able to:
1. Understand fundamental principles of solid state physics applied to devices.  
2. Analyse and calculate key semiconductor properties.  
3. Apply transport equations (drift and diffusion) to practical device situations.  
4. Work through crystallography problems, band diagrams, and Fermi-level calculations.
